===========

JSON-C wrapper

This is the sources repository for http://pecl.php.net/package/jsonc

This is *not* a drop-in alternative to PHP json extension.

json_encode *should* be the same as the current PHP one.

json_decode use the json-c library and is mostly compatible.
- > 64 bits integer are always parsed as integer (never float or string)
- 33 to 64 bits bits integer are parsed as float (or string) on 32 bits build
- It [fails to drop](https://github.com/remicollet/pecl-json-c/issues/9) invalid UTF-8 characters by default as it does not use `JSON_TOKENIZER_STRICT` by default.

A new option JSON_PARSER_NOTSTRICT allow to reduce parser strictness
- integer could start with zero
- string can be single or double-quoted
- comments are allowed in json string/files (Using /* */ or // until end of line)
- ignore trailing char after data

Also provide a new incremental parser object:

	$parser = new JsonIncrementalParser();
	$fic = fopen("somefile.json", "r");
	do {
		$buf = fgets($fic);
		$ret = $parser->parse($buf);
	} while ($buf && ($ret==JsonIncrementalParser::JSON_PARSER_CONTINUE));
	$result = $parser->get();

or, even simpler:

	$ret = $parser->parseFile("somefile.json");
	$result = $parser->get();
